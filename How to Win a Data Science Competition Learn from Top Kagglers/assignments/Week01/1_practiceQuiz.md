# How to Win a Data Science Competition: Learn from Top Kagglers (Week 1)

Question 1 
----------
Which of these methods are used by organizers to prevent overfitting to the test set using scores from the leaderboard?

 *Correct Answers:*
 
 - Splitting test for public/private

> The submissions are scored on public part of the test set while private score is only revealed when competition ends, thus it is not possible to overfit to private part

 - Adding Non-relevant samples to test set 

> Non-relevant samples make it much harder to do "leaderboard probing",
> i.e. get labels of individual objects based on leaderboard score

 - Limiting number of submissions per day

> This also makes "leaderboard probing" much harder
